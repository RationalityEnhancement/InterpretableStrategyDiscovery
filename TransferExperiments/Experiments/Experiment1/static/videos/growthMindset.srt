1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,009
- Here are two seeds.

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,110
Both planted on the same day,

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,102
in the same soil, in the same garden bed.

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,400
One is very curious, full of life

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,382
and ready to grow as tall as it can.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,513
The other is filled with fear.

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,350
"What if the sun is too strong

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,111
and burns my leaves
once I grow?", it thinks.

9
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,492
"Or what if a beast eats my tender sprouts?

10
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:50,899
No way!

11
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,913
Not a chance I am leaving my shell."

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,890
So, it remains still and
stagnant, rigid in its place.

13
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,160
The brave seed feels the
heat of the sun above

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,652
and starts to push hard out of its shell.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,890
Sure, it has doubts about
reaching the outside world,

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,343
but its curiosity is
stronger than anything.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,840
"I want to see all the living creatures

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,543
of this garden!", it thinks.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,239
"I can't wait to feel the
morning dew drops on my leaves."

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,030
The little seed keeps pushing

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,453
until a single sprout comes out.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,313
It grows and grows
through sunny warm days.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,529
It even grows through colder stormy days,

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,220
because the brave seed knows

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,513
that the sun will always return.

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,479
Throughout life, you will have moments

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,963
when you feel like either
one of these seeds.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,400
The way we see the world around us

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,403
and how we behave towards
life is called our mindset.

30
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,563
We can choose to have a fixed mindset,

31
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,342
or to have a growth mindset.

32
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,663
When you have a fixed mindset,
things can seem too hard.

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,690
Negative thoughts might cloud your mind

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,290
and you start to give up easily.

35
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,713
"I can't do this!"

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,280
You may believe that if you
are not good at something,

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,430
then you never will be.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,913
"I am just born this way."

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,453
The obstacles you face can hold you back,

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,693
and you begin avoiding challenges.

41
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,100
"What's the point of trying?"

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,662
Just like the fearful seed.

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,663
However, you can always choose
to have a growth mindset.

44
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,359
A growth mindset helps you believe

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,770
that your goals are within reach

46
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,693
with effort and perseverance.

47
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,533
"Life is a great big adventure!"

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,253
It shows you that failure is
a normal part of your journey.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,163
The obstacles you encounter
will only make you stronger!

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,323
"Challenges and mistakes help me learn."

51
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,090
You'll enjoy the challenges you face

52
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,390
and become more resilient.

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,313
"I want to become my best self!"

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,023
Just like the brave seed.

55
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,700
Fear is a natural emotion.

56
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,250
We all experience it

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,140
and it can make changing
your mindset difficult.

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,422
The important thing is to try,

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,570
so here are some tips

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,043
to switch on your growth mindset.

61
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,523
Perfection does not exist.

62
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,619
Aiming for perfection is like running

63
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,310
a race without a finishing line.

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,863
Trying to achieve it
will only exhaust you.

65
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,350
When negative thoughts fill your head,

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,103
you can turn them around by
simply adding "yet!" at the end.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,322
See challenges as adventures.

68
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,733
They will make you more resilient
and can open new worlds.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,442
If you work hard, you will see progress.

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,260
And don't worry about mistakes.

71
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,073
They are a part of life
and we can learn from them.

72
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,932
The good news is, the sun
always comes out after a storm.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,930
By having a growth mindset,

74
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,150
you might even find that a little rain

75
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,897
won't bother you much at all.
