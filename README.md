# AI-powered boosting

This is a repository associated with AI-powered boosting via decision aids: a project on automatically discovering interpretable descriptions of decision-making strategies and conveying those to people. This project is a part of a larger endeavor on improving human decision-making, and even larger endeavor of rationality enhancement and life improvement science.

## AI-Interpret

Navigate to RL2DT to learn more about AI-Interpret, an algorithm that automatically creates descriptions of decision strategies formalized in terms of (metalevel) reinforcement learning policies (Skirzyński et al., 2021).

## DNF2LTL

Navigate to DNF2LTL to learn more about DNF2LTL, a method for transforming the static output of AI-Interpret into a procedural description (Becker et al., 2022).

## Experiments

Navigate to the experiment folders in order to see the data gathered in experiments on the quality of AI-Interpret (Skirzyński, et al., 2021), the experiments showing people's preference towards procedural descriptions of decision strategies (Becker et al., 2022), as well as experiments showing the performance of AI-powered boosting via decision aids on naturalistic tasks (Becker et al., 2022).
