The ad.html has a very specific format.

Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
your hit.

The second part of the ad display after the person selected
"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

See comments throughout for hints

       <h1>Call for participants</h1>
       <p>The Rationality Enhancement Group at the Max-Planck-Institute
           for Intelligent Systems Tuebingen (Germany) is looking for online
           participants for an experiment on decision making.</p>

       <p>You will have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to $6 in
          addition to the base payment of $3. A typical payment is $6.5. The
          experiment will take roughly 50 minutes to complete.</p>

       <p>The requirements for participation are:</p>

       <ul>
          <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
          <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
          <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
          <li>You have not previously participated in one of our experiments.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
       may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

       <div class="alert alert-warning">
         <strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong>
         If you have already started or completed this task the system will not
         allow you to run again. If you have previously accepted a HIT
         with the same title as this one, please return this HIT.
     </div>
     <p>
         Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site
         above to begin the task.

     If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"

     You should thus show them instructions to begin the
     experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
     window pointed at your server.

                 It is important you do not change the code for the
                 openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
