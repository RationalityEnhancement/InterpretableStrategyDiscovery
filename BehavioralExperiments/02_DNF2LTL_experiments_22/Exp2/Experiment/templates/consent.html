        <p class="block-text">This is a psychology experiment being conducted by Frederic Becker from the Rationality
          Enhancement Group at the Max Planck Institute in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. In order to consent to participate, you
          MUST meet the following criteria:
          <ul>
            <li>18 years of age or older.</li>
            <li>Fluent speaker of English.</li>
            <li>Have not participated in this experiment before. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="block-text">
          This study is designed to look at how people make decisions. In this task, you will be asked to make choices and answer questions related to those choices.
        </p>

        <p class="block-text">
          Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you
          uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by stopping the experiment on Prolific
          and emailing the experimenter at the address provided below.
        </p>
        <p class="block-text">
          Other than monetary compensation, participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this
          research will benefit society at large. Many problems that people can solve very easily are very difficult to
          automate (to have computers solve). By revealing more about how humans learn and think, our research may help
          others to build and program computers that can solve these kinds of problems.
        </p>

        <p class="block-text">
          Your Prolific ID may be connected to individual responses, but we will not be asking for any additional
          personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot
          however guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data
          collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.
