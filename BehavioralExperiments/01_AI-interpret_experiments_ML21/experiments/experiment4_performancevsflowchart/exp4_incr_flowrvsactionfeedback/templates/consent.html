            <p class="block-text">This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Julian Skirzynski and Frederic Becker from Dr. Falk Lieder's Rationality Enhancement Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen, Germany. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>18 years of age or older.</li>
                    <li>Fluent speaker of English.</li>
                    <li>Currently in the United States.</li>
                    <li>US citizen.</li>
                    <li>Have not participated in this experiment before. </li>
                    <li>You have never participated in any of the previous experiments of our group.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="block-text">
                This experiment is designed to look at how people make decisions. In this task, you will be asked logical questions that help you make decisions and do decisions by yourself. The study will take about 8 minutes, and will pay $1 plus a performance-dependent bonus of up to $0.5. A detailed explanation on how the performance bonus is calculated will be given to you after you start the experiment.
            </p>

            <p>
              This experiment is not designed for smartphones or tablets. If you use such a device, please switch to a computer
              or release the HIT so someone else can take the experiment. We apologize for the inconvenience.
            </p>

            <p class="block-text">
            Your participation in this experiment is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by returning the HIT on MTurk and emailing the experimenter at the address provided below.
            </p>
            <p class="block-text">
            Other than monetary compensation, participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this research experiment will benefit society at large.
            </p>

            <p class="block-text">
            Your MTurk worker ID may be connected to individual responses, but we will not be asking for any additional personally-identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot however guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. If we publish the data, we will ensure that your Mturk worker ID is removed from the data so that there is no possibility of identifying you from your data.
            </p>

            <p class="block-text">
                If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact Julian Skirzynski. He can be reached at re-mturk@tuebingen.mpg.de.
