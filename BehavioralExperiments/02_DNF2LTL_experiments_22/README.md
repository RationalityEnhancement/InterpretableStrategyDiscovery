Exp1: The experiment compares the interpretability of static descriptions and procedural instructions of a near-optimal planning strategy  in the color-coded Mouselab-MDP task.

Exp2: The experiment tests the boosting abilities of procedural instructions in two natural decision-making problems (the Roadtrip task and the Mortgage task)
