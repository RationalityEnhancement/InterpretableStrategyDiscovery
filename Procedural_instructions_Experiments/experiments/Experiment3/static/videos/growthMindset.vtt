00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.009
- Here are two seeds.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.110
Both planted on the same day,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.102
in the same soil, in the same garden bed.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.400
One is very curious, full of life

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.382
and ready to grow as tall as it can.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.513
The other is filled with fear.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.350
"What if the sun is too strong

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.111
and burns my leaves
once I grow?", it thinks.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.492
"Or what if a beast eats my tender sprouts?

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.899
No way!

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.913
Not a chance I am leaving my shell."

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.890
So, it remains still and
stagnant, rigid in its place.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.160
The brave seed feels the
heat of the sun above

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.652
and starts to push hard out of its shell.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.890
Sure, it has doubts about
reaching the outside world,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.343
but its curiosity is
stronger than anything.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.840
"I want to see all the living creatures

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.543
of this garden!", it thinks.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.239
"I can't wait to feel the
morning dew drops on my leaves."

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.030
The little seed keeps pushing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.453
until a single sprout comes out.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.313
It grows and grows
through sunny warm days.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.529
It even grows through colder stormy days,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.220
because the brave seed knows

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.513
that the sun will always return.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.479
Throughout life, you will have moments

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.963
when you feel like either
one of these seeds.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.400
The way we see the world around us

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.403
and how we behave towards
life is called our mindset.

00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:00.563
We can choose to have a fixed mindset,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.342
or to have a growth mindset.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.663
When you have a fixed mindset,
things can seem too hard.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.690
Negative thoughts might cloud your mind

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.290
and you start to give up easily.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.713
"I can't do this!"

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.280
You may believe that if you
are not good at something,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.430
then you never will be.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.913
"I am just born this way."

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.453
The obstacles you face can hold you back,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.693
and you begin avoiding challenges.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.100
"What's the point of trying?"

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.662
Just like the fearful seed.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.663
However, you can always choose
to have a growth mindset.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.359
A growth mindset helps you believe

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.770
that your goals are within reach

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.693
with effort and perseverance.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.533
"Life is a great big adventure!"

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.253
It shows you that failure is
a normal part of your journey.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.163
The obstacles you encounter
will only make you stronger!

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.323
"Challenges and mistakes help me learn."

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.090
You'll enjoy the challenges you face

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.390
and become more resilient.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.313
"I want to become my best self!"

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.023
Just like the brave seed.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.700
Fear is a natural emotion.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.250
We all experience it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.140
and it can make changing
your mindset difficult.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.422
The important thing is to try,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.570
so here are some tips

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.043
to switch on your growth mindset.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.523
Perfection does not exist.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.619
Aiming for perfection is like running

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.310
a race without a finishing line.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.863
Trying to achieve it
will only exhaust you.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.350
When negative thoughts fill your head,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.103
you can turn them around by
simply adding "yet!" at the end.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.322
See challenges as adventures.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.733
They will make you more resilient
and can open new worlds.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.442
If you work hard, you will see progress.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.260
And don't worry about mistakes.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.073
They are a part of life
and we can learn from them.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.932
The good news is, the sun
always comes out after a storm.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.930
By having a growth mindset,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.150
you might even find that a little rain

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.897
won't bother you much at all.
